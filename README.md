Welcome to the **Library E-Commerce App**, a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for library-related products.

Our team consisted of 7 members, including designers and backend developers, as the project also included a website.

The app achieved an **Excellent** grade, showcasing its robust architecture, user-friendly design, and extensive features.
